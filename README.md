# mkdm-cloudflare
MkDocs-Material setup with Cloudflare Tunnels

NOTE: You will need to make a directory using `mkdir docs` in the mkdocs root folder manually. 

Use `docker ps` to see whether the docker container has started yet. 

Configure a public hostname in Cloudflare Tunnels paired to a Cloudflare-managed domain address. Remember to map the ports properly.
